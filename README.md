# Project Overview

## Project Description

This is the project developed for internet techniques subject.
The project aims to present mathematical, physical, or computer science concepts through graphical animations (simulations) using JavaScript and CSS 3.0. The content will be interactive, allowing users to run animations without logging in, customize animation parameters, save selected parameters for later use, and access a user profile after logging in. The project incorporates HTML5 semantic elements, multimedia content using `<audio>` and `<video>`, and graphics created using `<canvas>` or SVG.

## Technology Stack

### HTML5
Utilizes semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>`. Multimedia content is presented using new elements like `<audio>` and `<video>`.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is employed for HTML5 document manipulation using functions like `getElementByID` and `innerHTML`, event handling through functions like `on..()` or `addEventListener`, and style property modifications like `style.display` (none and block). The project can use libraries such as Prototype or jQuery but not UI jQuery tools.

### Server-Side
Server-side programming languages include PHP, Python, or JavaScript (Node.js). Database options encompass relational databases (SQLite or PostgreSQL), key-value databases (BerkeleyDB), or document databases (MongoDB). User data storage post-login is achieved through session-based or JWT-based user authentication. Communication between client and server can be established using HTTP POST, AJAX, RESTful, or WebService.

## Additional Features (Extra Points)

### WebWorker Technology
The project can utilize WebWorker technology to perform specific tasks within the animation, earning an extra 5 points towards the final project grade.

## Validation and Compatibility

The project undergoes validation on the W3C platform, adhering to HTML5 and CSS standards. While the project can be optimized for a specific browser, it will be explicitly mentioned.

## Short description
The given project satisfies above requirements for both javascript and HTML5 semantics and uses python for backend operatons. The animation present in the project show the process of array sorting performed by different sorting algorithms.
